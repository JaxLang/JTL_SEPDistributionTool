        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Tools due with December deliverable right before Christmas (Except Eeli's).
            \item Meeting every week on Tuesday at 9:30 am, alternating between Annamaria and Jax. Starting with Jax on 4 November.
        \end{enumerate}

        \section{Task 5-3} 
        \href{https://seafile.utu.fi/d/9be7b991ef8a4a3588d0/files/?p=%2F05%20-%20Dresing%20WP5_Plan.pdf}{See slide 13 of Nina's WP5 plan for details of the tasks due.}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item ND wants to include SolarMACH (plots, 3D, and coordinate table).
            \item RV wants to provide pre-selected energy-species combos: 25-40 MeV.
            \item Keep the radial scaling, intercalibration, and background subtracting, but allow the user to input / change the values.
            \item Plots required: Timeseries, Gaussian gif images.
            \item Test the tool on the radio group and Farwa.
            \item Code should be almost entirely hidden, save for the user inputs and 1 main running function.
        \end{itemize}
        \textbf{Latitudinal Assessment:} Fit the ecliptic plane spacecraft then plot solar orbiter in the gaussian plots to see the offset. \\
        \textit{Jax:} Can we get a Bepi loader in time for this? We need to have 4 or more data points to fit the gaussian.

    \vspace{0.5cm}

        \textbf{Exclude:}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Model inputs and models.
            \item Linear fits to gaussian results.
            \item Contamination regions.
            \item Smoothing.
            \item External data.
        \end{enumerate}

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Focus on 14~MeV proton channels because they are smoother and easier to work with. Can change this later.
            \item Make the flare input optional and only consider spacecraft footprint longitude in calculations.
        \end{enumerate}

        The notebook should in the following order:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item User inputs event details.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textit{Optional: Flare location for reference in plots.}
            \end{itemize}
            \item Plots and prints SolarMACH details.
            \item Load spacecraft data:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item User confirms which Spacecraft to include. (Done as checkboxes with all of them ticked as default. If unticked, confirm that they're still included in final plot but not the fitting process.)
                \item User confirms options for channels in a dictionary with intercalibration factors. (Red box to warn users about changing the values themselves).
                \item User chooses the resampling time, default: 15 minutes.
                \item Intercalibration. User can opt out with True/False.
                \item Radial Scaling. User can opt out with True/False.
            \end{enumerate}
            \item Plot time series and allow user to define background for background subtraction.
            \item Calculate the Gaussian Fits 
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item First with \texttt{scipy.curve\_fit}, then with \texttt{scipy.ODR}, with the uncertainties.
                \item Save figures at each timestep into a subfolder as it runs.\\
                Gaussian curve left, intensity time series to the right with vertical line to indicate time step.
            \end{enumerate}
            \item Plot final time series with 3 rows of plots:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Intensity time series
                \item Gaussian center
                \item Gaussian width
            \end{enumerate}
            \item \textit{(Optional)} Gif of the gaussian figs saved in the sub folder.
            \item \textit{To do later:} Latitude fits with Bepi data. Try set up using manually loaded Bepi-SIXS data for now.
        \end{enumerate}

    \textbf{Deadline}: Week before Christmas, \textbf{Jax internal deadline: 1st week of December.}\\

    Jax to create a public github repo to share with others as we go.

    \textit{Attendees:} Nina Dresing, Jan Gieseler, Rami Vainio, Jax T Lang. \\

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Resampling should be done using the following calculations for the intensity $I$ and uncertainty $\sigma$.
        \begin{align}
            <I> &= \tfrac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^w I_j \\
            <\sigma> &= \tfrac{1}{n} \sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^w \sigma_j^2}
        \end{align}
        \item The order of operations should run as:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Load data (merge, omni, resample, etc)
            \item Background subtract
            \item Inter calibrate
            \item Radial Scale
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Radial scaling calculation is fine (although it should be done with integrals etc, this version is more than sufficient).
        \item Background Subtracting should only use the average of the background (not the avg - std deviation like I had it). The background also needs to be calculated like the equations given in the resampling point.
        \item JTL aims to be done by Friday (21 November 2025) and thereafter just polishing and testing new events.
        \item RV not joining for next meeting on 2 December 2025.
        \item Meeting on 16 December 2025 merged with JTL's quarterly update with ND and RV.
    \end{enumerate}
